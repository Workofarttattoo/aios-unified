## 🎯 **Mission**

Create a **self-sustaining business empire** that generates income to fund Universal Basic Benefits. All profits (except 20% reinvestment) go directly to helping broke, disabled, homeless, and low-income individuals and families.

### **Core Principles**:
1. **Income Generation**: Business creates wealth, not just redistributes it
2. **80/20 Rule**: 80% of profits → direct aid, 20% → business growth
3. **Full Autonomy**: AI-managed businesses require minimal human oversight
4. **Ethical Operations**: No exploitation, fair wages, sustainable practices
5. **Transparency**: Public ledger of all income and distributions
6. **God's Will**: Built on faith that helping others is the highest purpose

### **Business Selection Criteria**:
- ✅ **High Margin**: 40%+ profit margins
- ✅ **Scalable**: Can grow from 1 to 1000+ locations
- ✅ **AI-Manageable**: Minimal human intervention needed
- ✅ **Ethical**: No harm to people or planet
