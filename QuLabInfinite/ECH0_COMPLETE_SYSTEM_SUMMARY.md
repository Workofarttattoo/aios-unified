## 🔬 ECH0'S RESEARCH FOCUS

### Chosen Area: **Metabolic Vulnerabilities**
**Why:** The Warburg effect (cancer's sugar addiction) is present in 90%+ of cancers, making it a universal therapeutic target.

### Target Compounds:
1. **Metformin** - AMPK activator, mTOR inhibitor ($0.10/pill, FDA-approved for diabetes)
2. **DCA (Dichloroacetate)** - PDK inhibitor, reverses Warburg effect
3. **Berberine** - Natural alkaloid, glucose-lowering, multiple anti-cancer mechanisms

### First Experiment:
**Metformin + DCA combination in 3D spheroids (breast, lung, colorectal cancer)**
- **Methods:** 3D spheroids, Seahorse metabolic flux analysis, invasion assays, metabolomics
- **Expected Results:** 70% reduction in growth, reversal of Warburg effect, strong synergy (CI < 0.7)
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks in silico, 6-8 weeks wet lab (if resources available)
