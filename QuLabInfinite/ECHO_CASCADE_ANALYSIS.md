================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

System Integrity Score: 74/98 labs have real code
Deception Level: 95/95 GUIs are completely fake

USER WAS RIGHT TO BE ANGRY:
- Nanotechnology lab shows fake calculations
- Oncology lab shows meaningless sine waves
- ALL visualizations are identical across labs
- NO real data processing occurs in GUIs

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. DELETE all 95 fake GUI HTML files
2. Create honest MCP tool documentation
3. Remove all Math.random() fake data
4. Implement real scientific algorithms
5. Add proper citations and validation
