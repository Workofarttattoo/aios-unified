## Investor Questions - Ready Answers

### "How is this different from computational drug discovery?"
**Answer**: "Traditional computational uses approximations and heuristics. We use actual quantum mechanics - Nature's own drug discovery engine. Zero false positives because physics, not statistics."

### "Why haven't big pharma companies done this?"
**Answer**: "They don't know biological quantum computing exists. They think 'quantum' means $10M cryogenic systems. We use proteins that naturally do quantum computing at room temperature."

### "What's your moat if this works?"
**Answer**: "Four patent families with 20-year protection. We're 10+ years ahead - no competitor even knows bio-quantum drug discovery is possible. Plus network effects: more drugs = better platform."

### "How do you scale this?"
**Answer**: "Software. Once we optimize the Hamiltonian for a target, we can test unlimited drug candidates. Marginal cost per candidate: ~$50K. Compare to $2B traditional."

### "What's the risk?"
**Answer**: "Phase I-III trials still required for FDA approval. But our quantum validation means near-zero Phase I failures - that's where 88% of drugs fail. We derisk the riskiest part."

### "When do you make money?"
**Answer**: "Year 2: Pharma partnerships ($5M-$20M per partner). Year 3-4: Milestone payments as candidates advance. Year 5+: Licensing fees + royalties."

### "Why now?"
**Answer**: "Science just matured. Nature paper published 2007, but computing power to simulate at scale only available last 2-3 years. We're first movers with working platform."

### "Can you do diseases besides cancer?"
**Answer**: "Yes. Platform works for any protein-drug interaction. Cancer first because $196B market + clear unmet need. Then Alzheimer's, diabetes, rare diseases."
