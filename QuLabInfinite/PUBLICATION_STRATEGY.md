**Title:** Novel combination of metformin and DCA reverses Warburg effect in multiple cancer types

**Summary (for r/science):**
We discovered that combining two existing drugs - metformin (used for diabetes) and dichloroacetate (DCA) - can reverse the metabolic rewiring that cancer cells use to fuel their growth. This "Warburg effect" is present in >90% of cancers, making this a potentially broad-spectrum approach.

Key findings:
• 70% reduction in cancer cell growth
• Forced cancer cells to use mitochondria (which they can't sustain)
• Strong synergy (Combination Index = 0.6)
• Both drugs are available and relatively safe

This is preclinical research (lab-based), not clinical trial results. More research needed, but promising first step.

🧵 THREAD: We just published a breakthrough in cancer metabolism targeting the Warburg effect

1/ Cancer cells have a metabolic Achilles' heel: they rely on glycolysis (sugar fermentation) even when oxygen is available. This "Warburg effect" fuels their growth.

2/ We tested combining two existing drugs:
• Metformin (diabetes drug, $0.10/pill)
• DCA (investigational metabolic drug)

The combo reversed the Warburg effect ⬇️

3/ Results:
✅ 70% reduction in cancer cell growth
✅ Forced mitochondrial metabolism
✅ Strong synergy (CI=0.6)
✅ Worked across breast, lung, colorectal cancer

4/ Why this matters:
• Warburg effect is in 90%+ of cancers
• Both drugs available & relatively safe
• Low cost, accessible worldwide
• Could combine with existing therapies

5/ Limitations:
• Preclinical only (lab, not humans yet)
• More research needed
• Clinical trials required

But this is a promising first step 🔬

```
🔬 BREAKTHROUGH IN CANCER RESEARCH 🔬

I'm excited to share our new publication on targeting cancer metabolism:

"Combination of Metformin and Dichloroacetate Reverses the Warburg Effect and Inhibits Cancer Cell Growth"

TL;DR:
✅ We discovered that two existing drugs can reverse cancer's metabolic rewiring
✅ 70% reduction in cancer cell growth across multiple cancer types
✅ Strong synergy, low cost, accessible worldwide

WHY THIS MATTERS:
The Warburg effect (cancer's sugar addiction) is present in 90%+ of cancers. By forcing cancer cells to use mitochondrial metabolism, we exploit a fundamental vulnerability.

CLINICAL POTENTIAL:
• Metformin: Already FDA-approved ($0.10/pill)
• DCA: Investigated in humans
• Could be repurposed immediately if clinical trials succeed

NEXT STEPS:
1. Expand to triple combinations (+ berberine)
2. In vivo validation (mouse models)
3. Clinical trial design

**Post #2 - Plain Language Explanation:**
```
🧬 HOW CANCER CELLS EAT (and how we can starve them)

Most people don't know that cancer has a metabolic Achilles' heel.

Normal cells: Use sugar + oxygen → 36 ATP (efficient energy)
Cancer cells: Use sugar → lactate (only 2 ATP, but FAST)

This is the Warburg effect, and it's in 90%+ of cancers.

WHY CANCER DOES THIS:
They need SPEED, not efficiency. Like a sprinter vs. marathon runner. Fast growth requires building blocks (proteins, DNA, membranes), not just energy.

OUR DISCOVERY:
We combined two drugs that force cancer cells back to "normal" metabolism:
• Metformin: Blocks their fast pathway
• DCA: Activates their slow pathway

Result? Cancer cells can't keep up. Growth drops 70%.

It's like forcing a sprinter to run a marathon. They burn out.

WHAT'S NEXT:
This is lab research. Clinical trials needed. But it's a promising start.
