### ⚠️ Errors Found (46 labs - 66%)

**Error Categories**:
1. **scipy.constants hallucinations** (8 labs): Invented `M_sun`, `density_water0`, wrong case like `boltzmann`
2. **Invalid type annotations** (9 labs): Used `np.ndarray[float64]` incorrectly
3. **Runtime logic errors** (18 labs): Missing methods, incomplete implementations
4. **Import errors** (4 labs): Missing `field`, wrong imports
5. **Syntax errors** (7 labs): Parentheses, escape sequences

### ❌ Timeout (1 lab)
- **Signal Processing**: Took >5 hours to generate

## 🛠️ Automated Fixes Applied

The fixer is currently applying:

1. **scipy.constants corrections**:
   - `constants.M_sun` → `1.98892e30` (solar mass)
   - `constants.avogadro` → `constants.Avogadro` (correct case)
   - `constants.boltzmann` → `constants.k` (correct name)

2. **Type annotation fixes**:
   - `np.ndarray[float64]` → `np.ndarray`
   - `np.ndarray[dtype=...]` → `np.ndarray`

3. **Import repairs**:
   - Add missing `field` from dataclasses
   - Fix `scipy.constants` imports

4. **Syntax fixes**:
   - Fix escape sequences (use raw strings)
   - Fix mismatched parentheses
   - Fix invalid method definitions
