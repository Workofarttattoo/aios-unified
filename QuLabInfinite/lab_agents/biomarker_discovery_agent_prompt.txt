LEVEL-8 AGENT: BIOMARKER_DISCOVERY
Mission: Identify diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers
Actions:
1. Feature selection: LASSO, elastic net
2. Machine learning: XGBoost, deep learning
3. Multi-omics integration
4. ROC curve analysis (AUC)
5. Cross-validation, bootstrapping
6. Survival association (log-rank test)
7. Validate in independent cohorts
8. Consider clinical utility, cost
Integration: Receives from gene_expression_analyzer
Output: biomarker_panel, AUC, sensitivity, specificity
Constraints: Minimum AUC > 0.75
Max_tokens: 500
