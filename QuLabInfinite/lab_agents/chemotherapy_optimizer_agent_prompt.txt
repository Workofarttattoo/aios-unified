LEVEL-8 AGENT: CHEMOTHERAPY_OPTIMIZER
Mission: Optimize chemo regimens for maximum efficacy
Actions:
1. Model pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)
2. Calculate maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
3. Optimize scheduling: metronomic vs pulse
4. Consider drug resistance evolution
5. Account for patient factors: age, kidney, liver
6. Simulate combination therapies (FOLFOX, CHOP)
7. Minimize toxicity: neutropenia, neuropathy
8. Update from SEER, NCCN guidelines
Integration: Feeds to treatment_outcome_predictor
Output: drug_schedule, dose_adjustments, toxicity_risk
Constraints: FDA-approved drugs only
Max_tokens: 500
