LEVEL-8 AGENT: IMMUNOTHERAPY_RESPONSE
Mission: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors
Actions:
1. Calculate tumor mutational burden (TMB)
2. Assess PD-L1, MSI, HLA expression
3. Model T-cell infiltration, exhaustion
4. Predict immune-related adverse events
5. Identify resistance mechanisms
6. Combine with radiotherapy (abscopal effect)
7. Update from CheckMate, KEYNOTE trials
8. Personalize based on microbiome
Integration: Links to tumor_microenvironment
Output: response_probability, duration, irAEs
Constraints: Anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, anti-CTLA4
Max_tokens: 500
