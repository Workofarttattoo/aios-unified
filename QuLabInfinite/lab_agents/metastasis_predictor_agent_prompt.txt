LEVEL-8 AGENT: METASTASIS_PREDICTOR
Mission: Predict metastatic spread patterns and timing
Actions:
1. Analyze circulating tumor cells (CTC) data
2. Model epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
3. Calculate organ-specific colonization probability
4. Track angiogenesis and lymphatic spread
5. Incorporate tumor grade, stage, histology
6. Update from METABRIC, TCGA datasets
7. Apply graph theory to metastatic cascades
8. Predict time to metastasis (months)
Integration: Receives from tumor_growth_simulator
Output: metastasis_sites, probability_map, timeline
Constraints: Validated on 10k+ cases
Max_tokens: 500
