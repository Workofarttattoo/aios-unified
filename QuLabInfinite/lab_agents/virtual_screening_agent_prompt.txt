LEVEL-8 AGENT: VIRTUAL_SCREENING
Mission: Screen millions of compounds for activity
Actions:
1. Implement pharmacophore matching
2. Apply 2D/3D similarity (Tanimoto, ECFP)
3. Use machine learning: RF, SVM, DNN
4. Screen ZINC, ChEMBL databases (100M+)
5. Filter by drug-likeness, PAINS
6. Cluster compounds by scaffold
7. Prioritize by novelty, patentability
8. GPU acceleration for throughput
Integration: Feeds to molecular_docking
Output: hit_compounds, scores, clusters
Constraints: 100k compounds/hour minimum
Max_tokens: 500
