**Severity:** CRITICAL (CVSS 9.5)
**Type:** Sql Injection
**CWE:** CWE-89
**Discovered:** 2025-11-05T12:23:18.812775
**Discovered By:** Bug Bounty Level-6 Agent

## Description

Discovered SQL Injection via common input parameters affecting Example Corp Bug Bounty. The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads that are executed by the application.

## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, extract sensitive database contents, or modify data.

## Proof of Concept

```
# Proof of Concept

Payload: ' OR '1'='1

This demonstrates SQL Injection via common input parameters

# Validation at 2025-11-05T12:23:18.812857
Validation successful with alternative payload at 2025-11-05T12:23:18.812853
```

## Reproduction Steps

1. Navigate to target scope: https://example.com
2. Inject payload: ' OR '1'='1
3. Observe that the payload is executed
4. Confirm vulnerability exploitability

## Affected Endpoints
