  "description": "Discovered Path traversal in file operations affecting Example Corp. The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads that are executed by the application.",
  "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server filesystem.",
  "reproduction_steps": [
    "Navigate to target scope: https://example.com",
    "Inject payload: ../../../etc/passwd",
    "Observe that the payload is executed",
