# Path Traversal in Example Corp

**Severity:** HIGH (CVSS 7.8)
**Type:** Path Traversal
**CWE:** CWE-22
**Discovered:** 2025-11-06T23:36:31.147167
**Discovered By:** Bug Bounty Level-6 Agent

## Description

Discovered Path traversal in file operations affecting Example Corp. The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads that are executed by the application.

## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server filesystem.

## Proof of Concept

```
# Proof of Concept

Payload: ../../../etc/passwd

This demonstrates Path traversal in file operations
```

## Reproduction Steps

1. Navigate to target scope: https://example.com
2. Inject payload: ../../../etc/passwd
3. Observe that the payload is executed
4. Confirm vulnerability exploitability

## Affected Endpoints

- https://example.com

## Remediation

Validate file paths against allowlist. Use secure APIs that prevent directory traversal. Implement proper access controls on filesystem operations.
