  "severity": "critical",
  "vuln_type": "sql_injection",
  "description": "Discovered SQL Injection via common input parameters affecting SecureApp Inc. The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads that are executed by the application.",
  "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, extract sensitive database contents, or modify data.",
  "reproduction_steps": [
    "Navigate to target scope: https://secureapp.com",
    "Inject payload: ' OR '1'='1",
    "Observe that the payload is executed",
    "Confirm vulnerability exploitability"

  "cvss_score": 9.5,
  "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
  "remediation": "Use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Never concatenate user input into SQL queries. Implement input validation and use an ORM where possible.",
