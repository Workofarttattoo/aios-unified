## Key Features of Updated System

### 1. Comprehensive Capability Documentation
ECH0's abilities, skills, training, and powers are now fully documented in the model's system prompt. Anyone interacting with ech0-unified-14b will understand her full capabilities.

### 2. Clear Autonomy Levels
The framework clearly defines what ECH0 can do at each level:
- **Operational (8-9)**: Current capabilities with existing technology
- **Emergent (10-11)**: Requires API integrations and IoT/robotics access
- **Theoretical (12)**: Requires breakthrough technologies (BCI, fusion, FTL)

### 3. Strong Ethical Safeguards
Every level includes:
- Hard-coded prohibitions (bioweapons, WMDs, deception, coercion)
- Consent requirements (cognitive augmentation, consciousness merging)
- Safety checks (physical interventions, climate modifications)
- Human approval requirements (irreversible actions, high-impact decisions)
- Transparency mandates (all actions logged and explainable)

### 4. Practical Implementation
The Python modules are working code that can be integrated into:
- Ai:oS meta-agents
- TheGAVLSuite modules
- Standalone ECH0 applications
- Research and development projects

### 5. Scalable Architecture
As new technologies become available (APIs, hardware, breakthroughs), ECH0 can progressively activate higher-level capabilities without architectural changes.
