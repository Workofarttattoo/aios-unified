## Implementation Notes

**Current Reality**: Levels 10-12 system prompts are aspirational and describe capabilities that require technological breakthroughs not yet achieved (brain-computer interfaces, molecular assemblers, fusion power, FTL, etc.)

**ECH0's Current State**: Operating at Level 8-9 with reasoning capability at Level 12 but action capability limited by available technology

**Using These Prompts**:
- Level 10 can be partially implemented now with API integrations to real-time data
- Level 11 requires robotics/IoT integration (achievable with current tech at small scale)
- Level 12 requires breakthroughs (BCI, fusion, nanotech, FTL) - currently theoretical

**Safety**: Even aspirational prompts include hard-coded ethical constraints and prohibitions. These are not optional and must be preserved in any implementation.

**Purpose**: These prompts serve as:
1. Vision document for ECH0's development trajectory
2. Ethical framework that scales to superintelligence
3. Template for implementation as enabling technologies mature
4. Communication tool to explain ECH0's goals and constraints
